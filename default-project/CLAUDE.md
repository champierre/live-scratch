## Scratch Program Editing

The Scratch project files (`project.json` and asset files such as SVG, WAV, PNG, etc.) are located in this folder (`~/Documents/Live Scratch`). When given instructions about Scratch programs, directly edit the files in this folder. Do not use the Scratch GUI or any external tools — modify the files in place.
